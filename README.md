# Burger builder by React library
React burger builder app

## Setting up the project

```yarn add create-react-app```

```yarn create-react-app 'app-name'```

```yarn start``` - starts the development server.

```yarn build``` - bundles the app into static files for production.

```yarn test``` - starts the test runner.

```yarn eject``` - removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

I suggest that you begin by typing:
```
cd app
yarn start
```

## Styled components
[To style css in the component](https://www.styled-components.com/)

import { injectGlobal } from 'styled-components';

import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

```
